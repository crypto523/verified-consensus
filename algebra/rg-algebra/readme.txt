=====================
Set-up Instructions
=====================

The source in this repository is to be opened with Isabelle (Isabelle2020 at time of writing).
It can be obtained here: https://isabelle.in.tum.de/

To ensure symbols for weak conjunction, iteration and other operators render correctly, 
you should copy the 'symbols' file to the following directory (depending on your computer):

macOS/Linux: ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2021/etc
Windows: C:\Users\<user>\.isabelle\Isabelle2021\etc

If you already have symbols defined, it may be better to append these to your existing symbols file.

The main theory file is AbstractAtomicTest/Programming_Constructs.thy
