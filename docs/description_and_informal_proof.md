Verified optimised epoch processing
===================================

Implementations of the Ethereum [consensus specification][consensus-specs] typically make use of
algorithmic optimisations to achieve high performance. The correctness of these optimisations is
critical to Ethereum's security, and so far they have been checked by manual review, testing and
fuzzing. To further increase assurance we propose to formally prove correctness of an optimised
implementation.

This document describes the optimised implementation which we are in the process of verifying,
and includes a high-level argument for its correctness.

## Scope

We only consider the `process_epoch` function which is responsible for computing state changes at
the end of each 32-slot epoch. Block processing (`process_block`) is considered out of scope for now
but may be covered by future work.

Our goal is to verify an implementation of `process_epoch` containing the minimum number of $O(n)$
iterations over the validator set ($n$ is the number of validators). We consider not only the
`state.validators` field, but also the other length $n$ fields of the state including:

- `.validators`
- `.balances`
- `.previous_epoch_participation`
- `.current_epoch_participation`
- `.inactivity_scores`

The specification version targeted is v1.3.0, for the Capella hard fork. We anticipate that the
proofs will be able to be updated for Deneb quite easily because there are minimal changes to epoch
processing in the Deneb fork.

## Motivation

As the validator set grows the amount of computation required to process blocks and states
increases. If the algorithms from [consensus-specs][] were to be used as-is, the running time of
`process_epoch` would be increasing quadratically $(O(n^2))$ as validators are added.

Another motivation for optimising epoch processing is that it grants implementations the freedom to
explore different state models. Some clients have already switched their `BeaconState`
representation from an array-based model to a tree-based model, which allows for better sharing of
data between states, and therefore better caching. The downside of the tree-based model is that it
tends to have substantially slower indexing (e.g. computing `state.validators[i]`), and
iteration is slightly slower (same time complexity with a larger constant).

| Operation | Array-based | Tree-based  |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| index     | $O(1)$      | $O(\log n)$ |
| iterate   | $O(n)$      | $O(c * n)$  |

Hence in the tree-based paradigm it becomes even more important to remove random-access indexing,
and to remove $O(n^2)$ nested iterations which amplify the higher cost of tree-based iteration.

## Algorithm Description

The key idea behind the optimised implementation is the combination of several stages
of `process_epoch` into a single iteration. This single iteration applies mutations to the
`validators`, `balances` and `inactivity_scores` in a way that preserves the semantics of the
original `process_epoch` function. Care is taken to ensure that reads and writes are not reordered
in a way that causes an overwritten value to be observed by a function which expects
to read the prior value. The spec's separate stages make this analysis of which fields are read and
written by individual functions quite straight-forward, and this forms a large part of our
correctness argument.

The stages of `process_epoch` which are combined into the single iteration are:

- `process_inactivity_updates`
- `process_rewards_and_penalties`
- `process_registry_updates`
- `process_slashings`
- `process_effective_balance_updates`

These functions represent the most computationally intense parts of `process_epoch`, with the other
functions not involving any $O(n)$ or greater processing. The exception is
`process_justification_and_finalization`, which is given special treatment due to its use of
aggregate information.

### Aggregates and Data Dependencies

The data dependencies between fields are such that the updated values of
`.validators`/`.balances`/`.inactivity_scores` for the $i$-th validator can be computed _mostly_
from the previous values for the $i$-validator. In other words, without dependence on the values
for other validators. This is the primary reason that we are able to fuse multiple mutations into
a single loop iteration.

The exception to this are the aggregate values which are computed over the entire validator set and
fed into the calculations for each individual validator.

The fundamental aggregate values are the sums of effective balances for different subsets of the
validator set. We consider 7 variations of these sums: 1 for the set of validators active in
the previous epoch (`total_active_balance`) and 6 for the subsets of validators active in the previous
and current epochs respectively, who attested correctly for each of 3 attestation flags (head,
target, source).

From these aggregate sums the finalization and justification aggregates are computed,
which also feed into later calculations. Conveniently, the aggregate sums can be computed _once_ at
the beginning of `process_epoch` and reused in all subsequent phases. The handling of these
aggregates happens as part of the _Progressive Balances Cache_ described below.

The activation queue also requires aggregation over the entire validator set, and we have a
two-phase process for this aggregation which is computed over two subsequent `process_epoch` calls.
See the _Activation Queue_ section below.

Other aggregate values include the `churn_limit`, the exit queue, and the base rewards, which are
derived from other caches described below (see _Exit Cache_, _Base Reward Cache_ below).

## Modified `BeaconState`

We model the additional caches as fields of the `BeaconState`. These fields should be treated
differently from non-cache `BeaconState` fields, e.g. excluded from SSZ serialization and tree
hashing. Alternatively, implementations may wish to pass the caches around in a separate object.

```python
class BeaconState:
    # ... ordinary `BeaconState` fields ...

    # Balance sums for active validators & attestation participation flags.
    progressive_balances: ProgressiveBalancesCache,

    # Cache of validators that *could* be activated soon.
    activation_queue: ActivationQueue,

    # Cache of exits indexed by exit epoch.
    exit_cache: ExitCache,

    # Cache of base rewards and effective balances.
    base_reward_cache: BaseRewardCache,

    # Number of active validators in the current epoch.
    num_active_validators: uint64
```

During the course of epoch processing the caches are updated for the next epoch. When describing our
optimised epoch processing as "single-pass" we exclude the iterations required to build the caches
for the first time, because this is a one-off cost.

In the specification below we use computationally expensive predicates to assert the validity
of the caches. These predicates are not intended to be included in implementations, and our proofs
demonstrate that they hold over successive `process_epoch` calls.

## Progressive Balances Cache

We define the progressive balances cache as a structure holding the 7 aggregate balances like so:

```python
class ProgressiveBalancesCache:
    # Total active balance for the previous epoch.
    total_active_balance: Gwei
    # Attestation total balances for the previous epoch.
    # Indexed by `TIMELY_SOURCE_FLAG_INDEX`, etc.
    previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances: List[Gwei, 3],
    # Attestation total balances for the current epoch.
    current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances: List[Gwei, 3],
```

Since changes were made to fork choice to handle unrealised justification and finalization
(see [disclosure][fc_pull_tips_disc]), consensus clients need to run
`process_justification_and_finalization` after _every_ block. To do this efficiently, many of them
include a cache that is equivalent to the progressive balances cache. This cache is called
_progressive_ because it computes the aggregate sums incrementally, updating them after relevant
events in each block.

We define a helper function for calculations involving progressive balances:

```python
def get_flag_attesting_balance(state: BeaconState, flag_index: int, epoch: Epoch) -> Gwei:
    return get_total_balance(state, get_unslashed_participating_indices(state, flag_index, epoch))
```

A new cache may be initialized using `new_progressive_balances`:

```python
def new_progressive_balances(state: BeaconState) -> ProgressiveBalancesCache:
    total_active_balance = get_total_active_balance(state)
    previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances = [
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_SOURCE_FLAG_INDEX, previous_epoch),
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX, previous_epoch),
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_HEAD_FLAG_INDEX, previous_epoch),
    ]
    current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances = [
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_SOURCE_FLAG_INDEX, current_epoch),
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX, current_epoch),
        get_flag_attesting_balance(state, TIMELY_HEAD_FLAG_INDEX, current_epoch),
    ]
    return ProgressiveBalancesCache(
        total_active_balance=total_active_balance,
        previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances=previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances,
        current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances=current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances,
    )
```

The correct values of the progressive balances cache are defined by the `valid_progressive_balances`
predicate:

```python
def valid_progressive_balances(
    state: BeaconState,
) -> bool:
    return state.progressive_balances == new_progressive_balances(state)
```

Although in future work we may prove the correctness of a progressive balance cache implementation,
in this formalisation of `process_epoch` we assume that the cache is initialized correctly at the
start of epoch processing.

To update the progressive balances cache for the next epoch we use two functions. The first is
responsible for partly initializing a new cache for the next epoch:

```python
def new_next_epoch_progressive_balances(
    progressive_balances: ProgressiveBalancesCache,
) -> ProgressiveBalancesCache:
    # Set total active balance to 0, it will be updated in
    # `process_single_effective_balance_update`.
    total_active_balance = 0

    # Rotate current epoch to previous, and initialize current to 0.
    previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances = (
        progressive_balances.current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances
    )
    current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances = [0, 0, 0]

    return ProgressiveBalancesCache(
        total_active_balance=total_active_balance,
        previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances=previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances,
        current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances=current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances,
    )
```

The second function is responsible for updating the next epoch cache for changes in effective
balance during the current epoch transition:

```python
def update_next_epoch_progressive_balances(
    next_epoch: Epoch,
    next_epoch_progressive_balances: ProgressiveBalancesCache,
    validator: Validator,
    current_epoch_participation: ParticipationFlags,
    old_effective_balance: uint64,
):
    new_effective_balance = validator.effective_balance

    # Update total active balance.
    if is_active_validator(validator, next_epoch):
        next_epoch_progressive_balances.total_active_balance += new_effective_balance

    # Update the current epoch totals which are the *previous* epoch totals in the cache
    # and were computed with the validator's `old_effective_balance`.
    # Slashed validators are not part of the unslashed participating totals.
    if validator.slashed:
        return

    for flag_index in range(len(participation_flag_weights)):
        if has_flag(current_epoch_participation, flag_index):
            if new_effective_balance > old_effective_balance:
                next_epoch_progressive_balances.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[
                    flag_index
                ] += (new_effective_balance - old_effective_balance)
            else:
                next_epoch_progressive_balances.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[
                    flag_index
                ] -= (old_effective_balance - new_effective_balance)
```

## Activation Queue

Another aggregate computation requiring special consideration is the calculation of the activation
queue: the list of validators to be activated in the next epoch. The spec calculates this in its
own $O(n)$ iteration during `process_registry_updates`:

```python
# Queue validators eligible for activation and not yet dequeued for activation
activation_queue = sorted([
    index for index, validator in enumerate(state.validators)
    if is_eligible_for_activation(state, validator)
    # Order by the sequence of activation_eligibility_epoch setting and then index
], key=lambda index: (state.validators[index].activation_eligibility_epoch, index))
```

Instead of this loop, our algorithm computes the queue across two consecutive calls to `process_epoch` as part of the single-pass loops of each:

- In the first single-pass loop (end of epoch $N - 1$): add validators that *could* be eligible for
  activation at the end of epoch $N$ to a cache that is sorted by `(activation_eligibiliy_epoch,
  validator_index)`.
- In the second single-pass loop (end of epoch $N$): filter the validators from the preliminary
  queue based on whether their `activation_eligibility_epoch` is less than or equal to the
  finalized epoch, and the `churn_limit` (which bounds the number of activated validators).

Formally we define the activation queue as a structure:

```python
class ActivationQueue:
    # List of validators that *could* be eligible for activation.
    # Implementations should use a data structure with O(log n) inserts instead of a list.
    eligible_validators: [(Epoch, ValidatorIndex)]
```

Entry into the tentative activation queue is determined by the predicate
`could_be_eligible_for_activation_at(validator, N)`:

```python
def could_be_eligible_for_activation_at(validator: Validator, epoch: Epoch) -> bool:
    return (
        # Placement in queue *could be* finalized at `epoch`
        validator.activation_eligibility_epoch < epoch
        # Has not yet been activated
        and validator.activation_epoch == FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH
    )
```

This predicate is called for each validator during epoch processing at the end
of epoch $N - 1$ by the function:

```python
def add_if_could_be_eligible_for_activation(
    activation_queue: ActivationQueue,
    index: ValidatorIndex,
    validator: Validator,
    next_epoch: Epoch
):
    if could_be_eligible_for_activation_at(validator, next_epoch):
        self.eligible_validators.append((validator.activation_eligibility_epoch, index))
        self.eligible_validators.sort()
```

This is usually done as part of epoch processing for the previous epoch, although for cases where
that is not possible we also define an initialization function:

```python
def new_activation_queue(
    state: BeaconState
) -> ActivationQueue:
    activation_queue = ActivationQueue()
    next_epoch = get_current_epoch(state) + 1
    for (i, validator) in enumerate(state.validators):
        add_if_could_be_eligible_for_activation(activation_queue, i, validator, next_epoch)
    return activation_queue
```

The validity condition for the activation queue is:

```python
def valid_activation_queue(state: BeaconState) -> bool:
    return state.activation_queue == new_activation_queue(state)
```

During epoch processing for epoch $N$, the speculative queue is restricted based
on the true finalized epoch and the churn limit:

```python
def get_validators_eligible_for_activation(
    activation_queue: ActivationQueue,
    finalized_epoch: Epoch,
    churn_limit: uint64,
) -> [ValidatorIndex]:
    return [
        index for (eligibility_epoch, index) in activation_queue.eligible_validators
        if eligibility_epoch <= finalized_epoch
    ][:churn_limit]
```

## Exit Cache

We define an exit cache to remove the calculation of the `exit_epochs` in `initiate_validator_exit`.

Like the progressive balances cache, we define the cache and assume that it is
correctly initialized at the start of epoch processing.

```python
class ExitCache:
    exit_epoch_counts: dict[Epoch, uint64]
```

```python
def new_exit_cache(state: BeaconState) -> ExitCache:
    exit_cache = ExitCache(exit_epoch_counts={})
    for validator in state.validators:
        if validator.exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH:
            record_validator_exit(exit_cache, validator.exit_epoch)
    return exit_cache
```

```python
def valid_exit_cache(state: BeaconState) -> bool:
    return state.exit_cache == new_exit_cache(state)
```

Exits that occur during epoch processing are used to update the cache:

```python
def record_validator_exit(exit_cache: ExitCache, exit_epoch: Epoch):
    if exit_epoch in exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts:
        exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts[exit_epoch] += 1
    else:
        exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts[exit_epoch] = 1
```

Two accessors provide aggregated data for `initiative_validator_exit`:

```python
def get_max_exit_epoch(exit_cache: ExitCache) -> Epoch:
    if len(exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return max(exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts.keys())
```

```python
def get_exit_queue_churn(exit_cache: ExitCache, exit_queue_epoch: Epoch) -> uint64:
    return exit_cache.exit_epoch_counts.get(exit_queue_epoch) or 0
```

The `initiate_validator_exit` function is updated to use the exit cache:

```python
def initiate_validator_exit_fast(
    validator: Validator, exit_cache: ExitCache, state_ctxt: StateContext
):
    # Return if validator already initiated exit
    if validator.exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH:
        return

    # Compute exit queue epoch
    max_exit_epoch_from_cache = get_max_exit_epoch(exit_cache)
    exit_queue_epoch = max(
        max_exit_epoch_from_cache,
        compute_activation_exit_epoch(state_ctxt.current_epoch),
    )
    exit_queue_churn = get_exit_queue_churn(exit_cache, exit_queue_epoch)
    if exit_queue_churn >= state_ctxt.churn_limit:
        exit_queue_epoch += Epoch(1)

    # Set validator exit epoch and withdrawable epoch
    validator.exit_epoch = exit_queue_epoch
    validator.withdrawable_epoch = Epoch(
        validator.exit_epoch + MIN_VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWABILITY_DELAY
    )

    # Update cache
    record_validator_exit(exit_cache, exit_queue_epoch)
```

## Base Reward Cache

We use a cache called the epoch cache to persist values that are constant for the duration of an
epoch, and remain constant until the recalculation of effective balances in
`process_effective_balance_updates`. The cache is mainly useful for block processing, but is
included in our formalisation of epoch processing for future-proofing, and to reduce the difference
between practical implementations and this spec.

```python
class BaseRewardCache:
    # Effective balances indexed by validator index.
    # NOTE: this is redundant, but useful for block processing with tree-based states
    effective_balances: [uint64]
    # Base rewards indexed by effective balance in ETH (i.e. divided by the increment).
    base_rewards: [uint64]
```

The functions for initializing a new epoch cache depend on a correctly initialized progressive
balance cache:

```python
def compute_base_rewards(state: BeaconState) -> [uint64]:
    return [
        get_base_reward_fast(effective_balance, state.progressive_balances)
        for effective_balance in range(
            0,
            MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE + EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT,
            EFFECITVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT,
        )
    ]
```

```python
def new_base_reward_cache(
    state: BeaconState
) -> BaseRewardCache:
    effective_balances = [validator.effective_balance for validator in state.validators]
    base_rewards = compute_base_rewards(state)
    return BaseRewardCache(effective_balances=effective_balances, base_rewards=base_rewards)
```

```python
def valid_base_reward_cache(
    state: BeaconState,
) -> bool:
    return state.base_reward_cache == new_base_reward_cache(state)
```

The function to read base rewards from the cache is:

```python
def get_cached_base_reward(
    base_reward_cache: BaseRewardCache, validator_index: ValidatorIndex
) -> uint64:
    effective_balance_eth = (
        base_reward_cache.effective_balances[validator_index] // EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT
    )
    return base_reward_cache.base_rewards[effective_balance_eth]
```

### Num Active Validators

Many implementations already cache the number of active validators. We define it as:

```python
def new_num_active_validators(state: BeaconState) -> uint64:
    return len(get_active_validator_indices(state, get_current_epoch(state)))
```

The validity predicate is:

```python
def valid_num_active_validators(state: BeaconState) -> bool:
    return state.num_active_validators == new_num_active_validators(state)
```

We use this value to calculate the churn limit, avoiding the $O(n)$ iteration for
`get_active_validator_indices`:

```python
def get_validator_churn_limit_fast(state: BeaconState) -> uint64:
    return max(
        MIN_PER_EPOCH_CHURN_LIMIT, state.num_active_validators // CHURN_LIMIT_QUOTIENT
    )
```

### Overview for `process_epoch_fast`

```python
def process_epoch_fast(state: BeaconState) -> None:
    # Pre-conditions (not intended to be executed by implementations).
    assert valid_progressive_balances(state)
    assert valid_activation_queue(state)
    assert valid_exit_cache(state)
    assert valid_base_reward_cache(state)
    assert valid_num_active_validators(state)

    # [CHANGED] Use the aggregate sums to compute justification and finalization.
    process_justification_and_finalization_fast(state)

    # [CHANGED] Compute the majority of processing in a single iteration, utilising the progressive
    # balances for aggregates.
    process_epoch_single_pass(state)

    # [CHANGED] Reorder `process_eth1_data_reset` after `process_effective_balances` which is now
    # part of `process_epoch_single_pass`.
    process_eth1_data_reset(state)

    # [UNCHANGED] These functions are unaffacted.
    process_slashings_reset(state)
    process_randao_mixes_reset(state)
    process_historical_summaries_update(state)
    process_participation_flag_updates(state)
    process_sync_committee_updates(state)
```

### Modified justification and finalization processing

Calculation of justification and finalization is updated to use the progressive balances cache:

```python
def process_justification_and_finalization_fast(state: BeaconState) -> None:
    if get_current_epoch(state) <= GENESIS_EPOCH + 1:
        return
    total_active_balance = state.progressive_balances.total_active_balance
    previous_target_balance = (
        state.progressive_balances.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[
            TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX
        ]
    )
    current_target_balance = (
        state.progressive_balances.current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[
            TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX
        ]
    )
    weigh_justification_and_finalization(
        state, total_active_balance, previous_target_balance, current_target_balance
    )
```

### Single-pass epoch processing `process_epoch_single_pass`

We define a few helper data structures which are used to pass information around during
single-pass epoch processing:

```python
# Information about a single validator that is bundled for reuse.
class ValidatorInfo:
    index: ValidatorIndex,
    effective_balance: uint64,
    base_reward: uint64,
    is_eligible: bool,
    is_slashed: bool,
    is_active_current_epoch: bool,
    is_active_previous_epoch: bool,
    previous_epoch_participation: ParticipationFlags,
    current_epoch_participation: ParticipationFlags,
```

```python
# Information about the state that is fixed for the duration of single-pass processing.
class StateContext:
    current_epoch: Epoch,
    next_epoch: Epoch,
    is_in_inactivity_leak: bool,
    churn_limit: uint64,
```

```python
# Shared context for rewards and penalties calculations.
class RewardsAndPenaltiesContext:
    unslashed_participating_increments_array: [uint64; NUM_FLAG_INDICES],
    active_increments: uint64,
```

```python
# Shared context for `process_slashings` calculations.
class SlashingsContext:
    adjusted_total_slashing_balance: uint64,
    target_withdrawable_epoch: Epoch,
```

```python
# Shared context for `process_effective_balance_updates`.
class EffectiveBalancesContext:
    downward_threshold: uint64,
    upward_threshold: uint64,
```

We define initializers for these contexts:

```python
def new_slashings_context(
    state: BeaconState,
    state_ctxt: StateContext,
) -> SlashingsContext:
    adjusted_total_slashing_balance = min(
        sum(state.slashings) * PROPORTIONAL_SLASHING_MULTIPLIER_BELLATRIX, total_balance
    )
    target_withdrawable_epoch = (
        state_ctxt.current_peoch + EPOCHS_PER_SLASHINGS_VECTOR // 2
    )
    return SlashingsContext(
        adjusted_total_slashing_balance=adjusted_total_slashing_balance,
        target_withdrawable_epoch=target_withdrawable_epoch,
    )
```

```python
def unslashed_participating_increment(flag_index) -> Gwei:
    unslashed_participating_balance = (
        progressive_balances.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[flag_index]
    )
    return unslashed_participating_balance // EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT

def new_rewards_and_penalties_context(
    progressive_balances: ProgressiveBalancesCache,
) -> RewardsAndPenaltiesContext:
    unslashed_participating_increments_array = [
        unslashed_participating_increment(flag_index)
        for flag_index in range(NUM_FLAG_INDICES)
    ]
    active_increments = (
        progressive_balances.total_active_balance // EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT
    )
    return RewardsAndPenaltiesContext(
        unslashed_participating_increments_array=unslashed_participating_increments_array,
        active_increments=active_increments,
    )
```

```python
def new_effective_balances_context() -> EffectiveBalancesContext:
    hysteresis_increment = uint64(EFFECTIVE_BALANCE_INCREMENT // HYSTERESIS_QUOTIENT)
    return EffectiveBalancesContext(
        downward_threshold=hysteresis_increment * HYSTERESIS_DOWNWARD_MULTIPLIER,
        upward_threshold=hysteresis_increment * HYSTERESIS_UPWARD_MULTIPLIER,
    )
```

## Informal Proof Sketch

### Auxiliary Lemmas

**Lemma `justification_upper_bound`:** During epoch processing at the end of epoch
$N$, after running `process_justification_and_finalization` the current justified epoch of the
state is at most $N$.

**Proof**: By induction on $N$. For $N=0$, the current justified epoch is also 0. For later epochs,
`current_justified_checkpoint` is not modified outside of `process_justification_and_finalization`,
which either sets it to a checkpoint with epoch $N - 1$ (the previous epoch), the current epoch
($N$), or leaves it untouched ($N - 1$ by the inductive hypothesis).

**Lemma `finalization_upper_bound`:** If $N > 0$ then during epoch processing at the end of epoch
$N$, after running `process_justification_and_finalization` the finalized epoch of the state is at
most $N - 1$.

**Proof**: By induction on $N$. At the end of epoch $N = 1$ the finalized checkpoint remains at epoch
0 due to the early return for `current_epoch <= GENESIS_EPOCH + 1`. In subsequent epochs the
finalized epoch is set in `process_justification_and_finalization` to either the previous epoch's
current justified epoch (at most $N - 1$ by lemma `justification_upper_bound`) or the previous
epoch's previous justified epoch (at most $N - 2$ due to this value being set from
`current_justified_checkpoint`).

**Lemma `active_indices_fixed`:** The value of `get_active_validator_indices(state, N)` is the
same for all intermediate values of `state` during epoch processing at the end of epoch `N`.

**Proof:** TODO: aux lemma

**Lemma `prev_active_indices_fixed`:** The value of `get_active_validator_indices(state, N - 1)` is
the same for all intermediate values of `state` during epoch processing at the end of epoch `N`.

**Proof:** TODO: aux lemma

**Lemma `total_active_balance_fixed`:** During epoch processing at the end of epoch $N$,
the value of `get_total_active_balance(state, N)` is fixed for all intermediate states prior to
the execution of `process_effective_balance_updates`.

**Proof**: The total active balance is computed from the list of validator indices active in the
current epoch, which is fixed, per lemma `active_indices_fixed`. The other input is the
`effective_balance` for each validator, which is only updated in
`process_effective_balance_updates`.  Therefore the value of `get_total_active_balance` is constant
until `process_effective_balance_updates` executes.

**Lemma `base_reward_fixed`:** During epoch processing at the end of epoch $N$,
the value of `get_base_reward(state, index)` is fixed per-index for all intermediate states prior to
the execution of `process_effective_balance_updates`.

**Proof:** The base reward is computed from the validator's effective balance and the total active
balance for the current epoch, both of which are fixed until `process_effective_balance_updates`
executes (by lemma `total_active_balance_fixed`).

**Lemma `is_in_inactivity_leak_fixed`:** During epoch processing at the end of epoch $N$,
the value of `is_in_inactivity_leak(state)` is fixed for all intermediate states _after_ the
execution of `process_justification_and_finalization`.

**Proof:** The inactivity leak calculation depends on the previous epoch, which is fixed
for the given states (the `slot` being constant). Additionally it depends on the finalized epoch,
which can only change as part of `process_justification_and_finalization`.

**Lemma `is_eligible_fixed`**: For all intermediate states during epoch processing prior to `process_registry_updates` each validator's eligibility is equal
to the cached eligibility from the `ValidatorInfo`, i.e. `i in get_eligible_validator_indices(state) == validator_info_i.is_eligible`.

**Proof**: The eligibility of each validator depends on several fields: `activation_epoch`, `exit_epoch`, `slashed`, `withdrawable_epoch`. There are no inter-validator data dependencies (aggregation) so each validator's eligibility is independent of any changes to the rest of the validator set. The `slashed` field is not written as part of epoch processing and the other 3 fields
are only written as part of `process_registry_updates`. Supporting `call_db` queries:

```sql
> SELECT field FROM indirect_reads WHERE function = "get_eligible_validator_indices";
validators.activation_epoch
validators.exit_epoch
validators.slashed
validators.withdrawable_epoch
```

```sql
> SELECT DISTINCT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "validators.activation_epoch" OR field = "validators.exit_epoch" OR field = "validators.slashed" OR field = "validators.withdrawable_epoch";
process_registry_updates
initiate_validator_exit
```

**Lemma `get_validator_churn_limit_fixed`**: The churn limit computed by
`get_validator_churn_limit_fast(pre_state)` and cached at the start of single-pass epoch processing
is equal to the churn limit computed by `get_validator_churn_limit(state)` for all states during
epoch processing.

**Proof**: TODO: set of active validators for current epoch does not change

**Lemma `compute_activation_exit_epoch_fixed`**: TODO.

**Lemma `unslashed_participating_indices_fixed`**: Assume $N > 0$. For all intermediate states prior
to `process_participation_flag_updates` during epoch processing at the end of epoch $N$, each
validator's presence in the set of unslashed participating indices for the previous epoch is equal
to `is_unslashed_participating_index(validator_info[i], flag_index)`, i.e. `forall flag_index. i in
unslashed_participating_indices(state, flag_index, N - 1) ==
is_unslashed_participating_index(validator_info[i], flag_index)`.

**Proof**: Consider each index individually. Whether an index `i` appears in
`get_unslashed_participating_indices(state, flag_index, N - 1)` does not depend on any aggregate
data, and _only_ depends on fields of `state.validators[i]` and
`state.previous_epoch_participation[i]`. Therefore during each iteration of single-pass epoch
processing we just need to show that these fields are constant.  The validator's activity is
determined by its `activation_epoch` and `exit_epoch` which are constant per the lemma
`prev_active_indices_fixed`. Therefore `i in active_validator_indices` is equal to
`validator_info[i].is_active_previous_epoch`, which was cached at the start of the iteration. The
other relevant field of the `Validator` object is `slashed`, which is immutable throughout all of
epoch processing and is therefore safe to cache in `ValdidatorInfo.is_slashed`. Finally, consider
the participation flags for the validator in the previous epoch. During epoch processing, the
previous epoch participation flags are only written by `process_participation_flag_updates`, so the
value cached in `ValidatorInfo.previous_epoch_participation` is equal to the value used by
`get_unslashed_participating_indices(state, flag_index, N - 1)` for all intermediate states prior to
the execution of `process_participation_flag_updates` (which occurs _after_ single-pass epoch
processing). Supporting `call_db` analysis:

```sql
> SELECT * FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "validators.slashed";
# empty
```

```sql
> SELECT DISTINCT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "previous_epoch_participation";
process_participation_flag_updates
```

### Activation Queue Proof

**Lemma `aq_correct`:** The activation queue computed by `process_registry_updates` is equal to
the queue computed by `get_validators_eligible_for_activation`.

**Proof:**

- We handle epoch $N = 0$ separately. In this case the activation queue computed by
  `process_registry_updates` contains `churn_limit` validators with
  `activation_eligibility_epoch=0`. The tentative queue formed by calling
  `new_activation_queue` on any epoch 0 state contains all validators with
  `activation_eligibility_epoch < 1`, i.e. `activation_eligibility_epoch=0`. Due to
  `activation_eligibility_epoch` being immutable throughout block processing, it is sufficient
  to use any epoch 0 state. The filtering of the tentative queue by
  `get_validators_eligible_for_activation` does not remove any validators, because the finalized
  epoch is 0 and cannot change (`<= GENESIS_EPOCH + 1`). The tentative queue is sorted the same as
  the queue from `process_registry_updates`, and is reduced to at most `churn_limit` items by
  `get_validators_eligible_for_activation`. Therefore, as long as the `churn_limit` parameter is set
  to `get_churn_limit(state)`, the two queues are equal.
- For $N > 0$ we have:
    - In epoch processing at the end of epoch $N - 1$ we compute the tentative queue containing
      all validators with `activation_eligibility_epoch < N` that have not yet been activated.
    - In epoch processing at the end of epoch $N$ we know that the finalized epoch is $\leq N - 1$
      by the lemma `finalization_upper_bound`.
    - Validators do not become eligible for activation until the epoch *after* they are processed
      by `process_registry_updates`, which sets `activation_eligibility_epoch = current_epoch + 1`.
      Therefore validators that are marked eligible in epoch $N - 1$ have an eligibility epoch
      equal to $N$, and validators marked eligible in epoch $N$ have an eligibility epoch equal to
      $N + 1$. Neither are eligible for activation in epoch $N$, because the activation queue
      considers only validators with `activation_eligibility_epoch <= state.finalized_checkpoint.epoch <= N - 1`.
      Therefore the list of not-yet-activated validators in the tentative queue with
      `activation_eligibility_epoch < N` is a superset of the list of validators in the activation
      queue.
    - By filtering the tentative queue based on the new finalized epoch computed during epoch $N$,
      we obtain equality with the `activation_queue` from `process_registry_updates`. Due to the
      queue being sorted by increasing eligibility epoch, the `activation_queue` is a prefix of
      the tentative queue prior to filtering.
    - The churn limit used to limit both queues is equal, so the list of validators considered
      for activation is the same for both approaches.

### Justificaton and Finalization Proof

**Lemma:** Computing justification and finalization using the progressive balances cache via
`process_justification_and_finalization_fast` is equivalent to `process_justification_and_finalization`.

**Proof**: The progressive balances cache `p` satisfies `valid_progressive_balances(pre_state)` where `pre_state` is the state at the very start of epoch processing before any changes are made. During the execution of `process_justification_and_finalization`, the aggregate values `total_active_balance`, `previous_target_balance` and `current_target_balance` are equal to `p.total_active_balance`, `p.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX]` and `p.current_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG_INDEX]` respectively. This follows from the equality established by `valid_progressive_balances` and the fact that no modifications are made to `pre_state` before these values are calculated by `process_justification_and_finalization`. Therefore, both functions pass the same values to `weigh_justification_and_finalization`, and compute the same result.

### Inactivity Updates Proof

**Lemma**: The changes to each validator's inactivity score made by `process_single_inactivity_update` as part of `process_epoch_single_pass` are equivalent to the
changes made by `process_inactivity_updates`.

**Proof**: The calculation of inactivity scores can be broken down on an individual validator basis
because the only aggregate it depends on is `is_in_inactivity_leak(state)`. Per the lemmma
`is_in_inactivity_leak_fixed` the inactivity-status of the state is uniquely determined after the
processing of justification and finalization. Therefore both the spec (`process_inactivity_updates`)
and the single-pass algorithm (`process_single_inactivity_update`) use the same value for
`is_in_inactivity_leak`, which is cached in the `StateContext` at the start of single-pass epoch
processing. Validator eligibility as determined by `ValidatorInfo.is_eligible` is consistent
by the lemma `is_eligible_fixed`, therefore the indices processed by both algorithms are the same.
For each index, we look at whether the validator attested correctly to the target in the previous
epoch, and compute the same outcome due to `unslashed_participating_indices_fixed` (noting $N > 0$
because of the `current_epoch != GENESIS_EPOCH` check). The changes applied to the inactivity score
are derived from constants (`INACTIVITY_SCORE_BIAS`) and the validator's current score which we know
is consistent prior to the change, and also does not involve any inter-validator reads (inactivity
score `j != i` is irrelevant to the value of inactivity score `i`). Therefore the inactivity score
changes applied by single-pass epoch processing are equivalent to those made by
`process_inactivity_updates`.

### Rewards and Penalties Proof

**Lemma:** Computing rewards and penalties during `process_epoch_single_pass` is equivalent
to computing them using `process_rewards_and_penalties`.

**Proof:** In `process_rewards_and_penalties` rewards are computed for the entire validator registry
for each of the 3 attestation flags using `get_flag_index_deltas`, while
`get_inactivity_penalty_delta` computes the rewards for inactivity penalties. Our claim is that the
single-pass functions `get_flag_index_delta` and `get_inactivity_penalty` compute the same rewards
for each individual index, and that the fusion into a single loop does not affect the result.

For `get_flag_index_deltas` the main inputs are the list of `unslashed_participating_indices`, and
the `unslashed_participating_balance` derived from the participating indices and their respective
effective balances (`state.validators[i].effective_balance`). By the lemma
`unslashed_participating_indices_fixed` we know that the status determined by
`is_unslashed_participating_indices` in single-pass processing is consistent (noting that $N > 0$
due to the `current_epoch != GENESIS_EPOCH` check). This also implies the total unslashed attesting
balances in the progressive balances cache are correct, as they are correct at the _start_ of
single-pass processing (due to `valid_progressive_balances(state)`) and the unslashed participating
indices on which they depend are constant. Likewise the validator `effective_balance` field is
immutable until `process_effective_balance_updates` runs, and so the
`unslashed_participating_balance` is equal to the corresponding total balance from the
`progressive_balances.previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances[flag_index]`.

Having established that the list of eligible indices and the total unslashed participating balance
are equal, it remains to show that the delta computed for each validator index is equal under both
approaches. In the spec's implementation, `get_base_reward(state, index)` and
`is_in_inactivity_leak(state)` are the two remaining inputs to the reward calculation. We know
that the `base_reward` value used in `get_flag_index_deltas` is equal to the `base_reward` used by
single-pass rewards processing which was computed at the start of epoch processing, by the lemma
`base_reward_fixed`. For `is_in_inactivity_leak`, we know that the value cached by single-pass epoch
processing is equal to the value used by `get_flag_index_deltas` by the lemma
`is_in_inactivity_leak_fixed` (both single-pass processing and `get_flag_index_deltas` execute after
`process_justification_and_finalization`).

TODO: part of rewards and penalties (similar argument for inactivity penalty deltas)

Additionally, note that there is no data dependence between the values for different validator
indices, so it is equivalent to compute and apply all the deltas for validator index $i$
before computing any deltas for flag index $j$.

### Registry Updates Proof

**Lemma**: The changes to each validator `i` made by `process_registry_update_single` are equal to
the changes made to that validator by `process_registry_updates`.

**Proof:** Begin by considering the `activation_eligibility_epoch`. There are no inter-validator
reads required to determine the value of `activation_eligibility_epoch`, as the function
`is_eligible_for_activation_queue` reads only the `activation_eligibility_epoch` and
`effective_balance` for validator `i`. The `activation_eligibility_epoch` is only read and written
as part of the registry update procedures, and the `effective_balance` is only modified _after_
registry processing in `process_effective_balance_updates`. Therefore the single-pass function
`process_registry_update_single` and the spec both compute the same value for
`is_eligible_for_activation_queue`, and consequently set the `activation_eligibility_epoch` to the
same value for each validator.

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_reads WHERE field = "validators.activation_eligibility_epoch";
process_registry_updates
is_eligible_for_activation_queue
is_eligible_for_activation
```

Now consider the `exit_epoch` and `withdrawable_epoch` fields which are set by
`initiate_validator_exit` in the spec, or `initiate_validator_exit_fast` in single-pass processing.
The decision to exiting a validator is determined by their activity status (`is_active_validator`)
and their effective balance. As above, there are no inter-validator reads here, and the values for
both of these fields are equal to their values in the pre-state. Therefore the implementation
invokes `initiate_validator_exit_fast` if and only if the spec invokes `initiate_validator_exit`.

However, there is aggregation involved in `initiate_validator_exit` itself: the `exit_epochs` list
is built by collating the `exit_epoch` fields of the entire validator set. In single-pass epoch
processing this is replaced by a read from the `exit_cache`, which is _updated_ after each exited
validator. Proof of equivalence is by induction on the validator index `i`. We want to prove
that the spec and implementation compute equal values of `exit_queue_epoch` and `exit_queue_churn`, but strengthen the inductive hypothesis to:

```python
max(
    [v.exit_epoch for v in spec_state_i.validators if v.exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH]
) or 0 == get_max_exit_epoch(exit_cache_i) and all(
    len([v for v in spec_state_i.validators if v.exit_epoch == epoch])
    == get_exit_queue_churn(exit_cache_i, epoch)
    for epoch in range(0, FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH)
)
```

The first conjuct implies equality of the _initial_ value of `exit_queue_epoch` and the second
states that the exit cache contains the correct count of exiting validators for _any_ choice of
`exit_queue_epoch` (as the `exit_queue_epoch` may be different in different iterations), which is
sufficient to imply equality for `exit_churn_epoch`.

For `i=0` the inductive hypothesis holds because `valid_exit_cache` holds on the pre-state. The exit
cache contains a key for every `exit_epoch != FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH` of validators in the validator set,
so `get_max_exit_epoch(exit_cache)` yields a value equal to `max(exit_epochs) or 0` in
`initiate_validator_exit`, and the equality of the first conjuct follows from that. The second
conjunct also follows directly from `valid_exit_cache`: the counts held by the exit cache for each
epoch are exactly the counts computed by iterating over the validator set. Any epochs missing from
the cache are also missing from the validator set and result in `len([]) == 0` which is trivial.
It's worth noting that no mutations are made to the exit cache or validator exit epochs prior to
this point (the 0th iteration).

Supporting `call_db` analysis:

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "validators.exit_epoch";
process_registry_updates
initiate_validator_exit
```

In the inductive case `i=k + 1`, we need to prove that `record_validator_exit` at the end of
iteration `k` maintains the inductive hypothesis for the start of iteration `k + 1`, assuming that
it was upheld at the start of iteration `k`. We only need to consider the case where validator `k`
is actually exited, because in the case where they are not exited, the hypothesis is trivially
maintained (no changes to the `exit_epoch` imply no changes to the values in either conjunct).
We split the analysis of `record_validator_exit` into two cases: 1) When the exit epoch of
validator `k` (`exit_epoch_k`) is already present in the exit cache and 2) When the exit epoch of
validator `k` is _not_ present in the exit cache.

In case (1) `record_validator_exit` adds 1 to the count for `exit_epoch_k`. This does not affect the
value of the max `exit_epoch` for the spec or the cache, so the first conjunct follows trivially
from the inductive hypothesis. The second conjunct _is_ affected, with the validator object for `k`
having had its `exit_epoch` updated from `FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH` to `exit_epoch_k`. Therefore `len([v for
v in spec_state_k_plus_1.validators if v.exit_epoch == exit_epoch_k]) == len([v for v in
spec_state_k.validators if v.exit_epoch == exit_epoch_k]) + 1`. This is mirrored by the increment of
the exit cache entry for `exit_epoch_k`, which yields `get_exit_queue_churn(exit_cache_k_plus_1,
exit_epoch_k) == get_exit_queue_churn(exit_cache_k, exit_epoch_k) + 1`. These two terms (for spec
and impl) are then equal by substitution of the inductive hypothesis. Other `epoch`s covered by
the `all` quantifier have their values unchanged because iteration `k` only modifies validator `k`.
Therefore the equality of the second conjunct of the hypothesis is upheld.

In case (2) where `exit_epoch_k` is not in the exit cache it must be the case that either 2a) The
`exit_epoch_k` was _not_ incremented from its initial value or 2b) The `exit_epoch_k` _was_
incremented by 1 from its initial value. In case (2a) we can infer that the `exit_epoch_k` is equal
to `compute_activation_eligibility_epoch(..)`, as we know it can't take the same value as an
existing validator's `exit_epoch` beacause it is absent from the cache. Therefore
the maximum `exit_epoch` of any prior validator is `< exit_epoch_k`. The first conjunct follows
from this observation: the `exit_epoch_k` which is added to the validator set for validator `k`
becomes the new maximum, and matches the `exit_epoch_k` which is added to the cache and will be
returned by `get_max_exit_epoch(exit_cache_k_plus_1)`. The second conjunct also holds because
neither cache nor spec state contained an entry for `exit_epoch_k` prior to iteration `k`, and will
both have a count of 1 for `exit_epoch_k` at the end of iteration `k`. Similarly in case (2b) where
`exit_epoch_k` was incremented from its initial value, we can infer that there must have been
`churn_limit` validators with `exit_epoch` equal to the pre-increment value, i.e. `exit_epoch_k -
1`. Therefore the same arguments apply about the correctness of the updates as in case 2a (we know
the previous max exit epoch is `< exit_epoch_k` and `exit_epoch_k` is updated with a count of 1).

From the lemma proved by induction, it is straight-forward to derive equality for the
`exit_queue_epoch` and `exit_queue_churn` variables in
`initiate_validator_exit`/`initiate_validator_exit_fast` whenever they are invoked. We note that the
values of `get_validator_churn_limit` and `compute_activation_exit_epoch` are invariant for the
duration of epoch processing (see lemmas `get_validator_churn_limit_fixed` and
`compute_activation_exit_epoch_fixed`).

For the validator activations, we have equality on the activation queues used by single-pass epoch
processing and the spec by the [_Activation Queue Proof_](#activation-queue-proof). In addition to
this we note that the only field modified for each index as part of the activation phase is
`activation_epoch`. There are no inter-validator writes, and this field is only written as part of
`process_registry_updates`. The proofs for the other parts of single-pass epoch processing take care
to reason about reads from this value after it is updated out-of-order. Supporting `call_db`
analysis:

```sql
SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "validators.activation_epoch";
process_registry_updates
```

Therefore changes applied by single-pass epoch processing in `process_registry_update_single` are
equal to the changes applied by `process_registry_updates`.

### Slashings Proof

**Lemma**: The balance changes applied by `process_single_slashing` are the same as the balance
changes applied by `process_slashings`.

**Proof**: Two aggregates are used by `process_slashings`: the `total_balance` and
`sum(state.slashings)`, which are together used to compute `adjusted_total_slashing_balance`. By the
lemma `total_active_balance_fixed` we know that the `total_balance` used by the spec is equal to the
total balance of the pre-state at the start of epoch processing. Noting that in the spec
`process_slashings` occurs prior to the updates to effective balances in
`process_effective_balance_updates`. Therefore the total active balance from the progressive balance
cache is correct, as it matches the total active balance of the pre-state due to
`valid_progressive_balances`.

For the `sum(state.slashings)` aggregate, observe that the `state.slashings` field is only modified
by `process_slashings_reset`, which occurs after `process_epoch_single_pass` (and
`process_slashings` in the spec). Therefore it is safe to cache the value of
`adjusted_total_slashing_balance` which is computed from these two aggregates, at the start of
`process_epoch_single_pass` when the `SlashingsContext` is initialized.

Aside from the aggregates, `process_single_slashing` also interleaves the slashing-related changes
to validators with the other parts of single-pass epoch processing. A validator's correlated
slashing penalty is determined by three fields of `Validator`: `slashed`
`withdrawable_epoch` and `effective_balance`. As noted elsewhere, `slashed` is immutable during
epoch processing, so reordering the reads of `slashed` is safe. For `withdrawable_epoch`, this is
modified by the spec in `process_registry_updates` and by single-pass processing in
`process_single_registry_update`. In both cases, the changes for an index `i` only occur _after_
the calculation of the correlated slashing penalty, so at the point when single-pass epoch
processing reads `withdrawable_epoch` for a validator, it has the same value as in the pre-state.
And likewise for the spec. Hence the values are identical. A similar argument applies for the
validator's `effective_balance` which is only written during `process_effective_balance_updates` and
`process_single_effective_balance_update`, which occur after `process_slashings` (in the spec) and
after `process_single_slashing` (in single-pass processing), respectively.

Therefore the correlated slashing penalty calculated for each index is the same in both approaches.
It only remains to be shown that the balance change that results from the penalty is identical. To
show this, we note that the correctness proofs for the other parts of single-pass epoch processing
establish equality between validator `i`'s balance at the start of `process_single_slashing` and the
same validator's balance at the start of `process_slashings`. In other words, all the mutations
which are applied to a validator's balance (by `process_rewards_and_penalties`) happen on a
per-validator basis, and no iteration for an index `j != i` modifies the balance of validator `i`.
Therefore when the penalty is applied, it results in the same balance for `i` in both spec and
implementation, and maintains the invariant for the next step of single-pass processing.

Supporting `call_db` analysis:

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "slashings";
process_slashings_reset
```

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "balances";
process_slashings
process_rewards_and_penalties
increase_balance
decrease_balance
```

### Effective Balance Updates Proof

**Lemma**: The changes to each validator's effective balance made by
`process_single_effective_balance_update` as part of `process_epoch_single_pass` are equivalent to
the changes made by `process_effective_balance_updates`.

**Proof**: We assume that prior to the execution of `process_single_effective_balance_update` for
validator `i` that the balance invariant has been maintained, i.e. that the balance of validator `i`
in single-pass processing is equal to the balance of validator `i` in the spec's state prior to
the execution of `process_effective_balance_updates`. This invariant is established by the proofs
for the previous steps of single-pass epoch processing.

From this invariant we can deduce that the reads made by `process_single_effective_balance_update`
are consistent with the reads made by the spec. For validator `i` the only fields read are the
balance for `i` and the `effective_balance`. There is no aggregation, nor any inter-validator data
dependencies. The balance for `i` is equal by the balance invariant, and the `effective_balance`
is equal by virtue of being immutable in prior parts of epoch processing.

The other values that are cached in the `EffectiveBalancesContext` are derived from constant
configuration parameters, and are therefore immutable.

Supporting `call_db` analysis:

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "validators.effective_balance";
process_effective_balance_updates
```

_For consideration of the progressive balance cache changes made in
`process_single_effective_balance_update` see the **Progressive Balances Proof** below_.

### Eth1 Data Reset Proof

**Lemma**: Executing `process_eth1_data_reset` after `process_effective_balances` is equivalent to
executing it prior. As a result, the state computed by single-pass epoch processing after
`process_eth1_data_reset` is equal to the state computed by `process_epoch` after
`process_effective_balance_updates`.

**Proof**: Aside from reading the current slot, the functions `process_eth1_data_reset` and
`process_effective_balances` read and write disjoint sets of fields. A single field is written by
`process_eth1_data_reset`, namely the `eth1_data_votes`. This field is not read or written by
`process_effective_balances` nor indeed any other function. Therefore the mutations made by
`process_eth1_data_reset` and `process_effective_balances` commute, and the reordering is valid.

Supporting `call_db` analysis:

```sql
> SELECT field FROM indirect_writes WHERE function = "process_eth1_data_reset";
eth1_data_votes
```

```sql
> SELECT function FROM indirect_reads WHERE field = "eth1_data_votes";
# empty
> SELECT function FROM indirect_writes WHERE field = "eth1_data_votes";
process_eth1_data_reset
```

### Progressive Balances Proof

**Lemma**: After the execution of `process_epoch_fast` and the increment of the `state.slot`
(implied by `process_slots`) the progressive balances cache validity is maintained, i.e.
`valid_progressive_balances(state)`.

**Proof**: The cache for the next epoch $(N + 1)$ which becomes `state.progressive_balances` is
initialized by `new_next_epoch_progressive_balances` during `process_epoch_single_pass` for epoch
$N$. This cache starts off with the total active balance and current epoch flag balances set to 0,
and the current epoch $(N)$ totals rotated into the field for previous epoch totals. No
attestations have been processed for epoch $N + 1$ at this stage, so the 0 totals for the current
epoch flag balances are immediately correct.

The correct previous epoch ($N$) flag totals depend on the output of `get_total_balance` and
`get_unslashed_participating_indices` which in turn depend on `previous_epoch_participation_flags`,
and the validator fields `slashed`, `activation_epoch`, `exit_epoch` and `effective_balance`. The
`previous_epoch_participation_flags` are immutable apart from a rotation during
`process_participation_flag_updates` which mirrors the rotation applied to the cache. Therefore the
participation flags which were used in the calculation of the
`previous_epoch_flag_attesting_balances` are the ones which _should_ have been used for calculating
the totals, and no additional adjustments are required on account of the participation flags.

Similarly, the `slashed` field is immutable during epoch processing, and no adjustments are required
on account of it. The activity-related fields `activation_epoch` and `exit_epoch` are more subtle,
but ultimately inconsequential. Although they are mutated by `process_registry_updates` during epoch
processing, they do not affect the validator's activity at epoch $N$, i.e. the value of
`is_active_validator(validator, N)`. The `activation_epoch` is only set for new validators, to
epochs in the future (validators are never activated at past epochs). The `exit_epoch` is likewise
only set to future epochs for validators exiting due to the inactivity leak (validators are not
exited at past epochs).

In contrast, the `effective_balance`s which were used to calculate the previous epoch totals _do_
have the ability to change during epoch processing, meaning that the initial totals set by
`new_next_epoch_progressive_balances` are incorrect. The function
`update_next_epoch_progressive_balances` corrects this for each relevant validator by applying a
balance diff. If the validator is unslashed and has a participation flag set in the current (soon to
be previous) epoch $(N)$ then a balance diff corresponding to the change in their effective balance
is applied. Slashed validators are excluded, because their effective balances never contributed to
the original totals. The `current_epoch_participation` is used because the participation bits have
not yet been rotated when `update_next_epoch_progressive_balances` runs as part of single-pass
processing.

Finally, the `total_active_balance` is also updated as part of
`update_next_epoch_progressive_balances` for all validators that will be active in the next (soon to
be current) epoch $N + 1$. The value of `is_active_validator(validator, N + 1)` does not change
between when this calculation is made and when epoch-processing completes, and this can be proved in
two ways. 1) The minimum value that an `activation_epoch` or `exit_epoch` can be updated to is
`compute_activation_exit_epoch(N) = N + 5` (with `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD = 4`). 2) Alternatively,
even if `MAX_SEED_LOOKAHEAD` were configured to 0, the registry changes for validators are applied
prior to the effective balance update, in `process_single_registry_update`. This means that the
values of `activiation_epoch` and `exit_epoch` read for validator `i` at this point are the final
values which persist in the final state (and would be read by ` valid_progressive_balances(state)`
after slot processing). Our formal proof will use whichever property is easier to establish.
