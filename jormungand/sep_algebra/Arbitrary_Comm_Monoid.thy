imports Main
begin

text \<open>
  We define operations "arbitrary_add" and "arbitrary_zero"
  to represent an arbitrary commutative monoid.
\<close>

definition
  arbitrary_add :: "'a \<Rightarrow> 'a \<Rightarrow> 'a"
  (infixl "+\<^sub>?" 65)
where
  "arbitrary_add a b \<equiv> fst (SOME (f, z). comm_monoid f z) a b"

definition
  arbitrary_zero :: "'a"
  ("0\<^sub>?")
where
 "arbitrary_zero \<equiv> snd (SOME (f, z). comm_monoid f z)"

text \<open>
  For every type, there exists some function @{term f} and
  identity @{term e} on that type forming a monoid.
\<close>
lemma comm_monoid_exists:
      "\<exists>f e. comm_monoid f e"
proof cases
  assume two_elements: "\<exists>(a :: 'a) b. a \<noteq> b"

  obtain x e where diff: "x \<noteq> (e :: 'a)"
    by (atomize_elim, clarsimp simp: two_elements)

  define f where "f \<equiv> \<lambda>a b. (if a = e then b else (if b = e then a else x))"

  have "\<forall>a b. f a b = f b a"
    by (simp add: f_def)
  moreover have "\<forall>a b c. f (f a b) c = f a (f b c)"
    by (simp add: diff f_def)
  moreover have "\<forall>b. f e b = b"
    by (simp add: diff f_def)
